Sugar Removal Utility Command Line Application Usage instructions v. 1.1.0.0
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This application can be used to remove sugar moieties from molecules in a given data set, according 
to "Schaub, J., Zielesny, A., Steinbeck, C., Sorokina, M. Too sweet: cheminformatics for deglycosylation in natural
products. J Cheminform 12, 67 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-020-00467-y".

Accepted input formats: MDL Molfile, MDL Structure data file (SDF), and SMILES file (of 
format: [SMILES string][space][name] in each line, see example file)

The output is a comma-separated value (CSV) text file containing: 
- the respective number of each molecule in the input file
- detected identifiers of the molecules
- SMILES strings of the original molcules
- SMILES strings of the deglycosylated molecules
- SMILES strings of the removed sugar moieties

The output file and a log file will be created in the same directory as the input file.

To run the application, execute the supplied executable JAR file from the command line, using 
the 'java -jar' command (see example usages at the end of this document). 

Java version 11 or higher needs to be installed on your machine.

Also, multiple command line arguments/options are available (some optional, some required) when executing 
the JAR file. These are (-[short name] --[long name] <argument>):

java -jar SugarRemovalUtility-jar-with-dependencies.jar -i <filePath> -t <integer> 
	[-glyBond <boolean>] [-remTerm <boolean>] [-presMode <integer>] [-presThres <integer>] 
	[-oxyAtoms <boolean>] [-oxyAtomsThres <number>] [-linSugInRings <boolean>] [-linSugMinSize <integer>] 
	[-linSugMaxSize <integer>][-linAcSug <boolean>] [-circSugSpiro <boolean>]

- Option -h --help: Print usage and help information regarding the required command-line arguments and 
  options. If this option is used, the application is exited afterwards.
- Option -v --version: Print version of the Sugar Removal Utility Command-Line Application. If this 
  option is used, the application is exited afterwards.

- Option -i --inputFilePath <filePath>: Path to the input file
	- Either absolute or relative to the current directory
	- Example: "D:\Project_Sugar_Removal\SugarRemovalUtility CMD App\smiles_test_file.txt" or 
	  "smiles_test_file.txt" if your console is already in the 'SugarRemovalUtility CMD App' 
	  directory
	- The backslahes '\' are used in a Microsoft Windows operating system; it should be slash 
	  '/' in a Unix shell
	- Double quotes " are not mandatory but recommended to allow for spaces in the path
	- The path must not be empty and the given file must exist and be accessible and readable
	- The file type extension is not important for the determination of the file type but it 
	  must be specified in the path
	- See accepted input formats above
	- This option and its argument are always required
- Option -t --typeOfMoietiesToRemove <integer>: A number of ["1","2","3"] indicating which type 
  of sugar moieties should be removed
	- "1": Circular sugar moieties
	- "2": Linear sugar moieties
	- "3": Circular AND linear sugar moieties
	- This option and its argument are always required

-> These two options must ALWAYS be given (except if --help or --version are used). The remaining 
   arguments are optional. If they are not specified, they will be in their default value.

- Option -glyBond --detectCircSugOnlyWithGlyBond <boolean>: Either "true" or "false", indicating 
  whether circular sugars should be detected (and removed) only if they have an O-glycosidic bond 
  to another moiety or the core of the molecule. 
	- Any other value of this argument will be interpreted as "false"
	- Default: "false"
- Option -remTerm,--removeOnlyTerminalSugars <boolean>: Either "true" or "false", indicating whether 
  only terminal sugar moieties should be removed.
	- Any other value of this argument will be interpreted as "false"
	- Default: "true"
	- Important note: If this setting is set to "true", the input molecules must all consist 
	  of one connected structure, respectively. If they already contain multiple, disconnected 
	  structures (e.g. counter-ions), the respective molecules are ignored.
- Option -presMode --preservationModeOption <integer>: A number of ["0","1","2"] indicating which 
  preservation mode to use. This specifies under what circumstances to preserve or discard structures 
  that get disconnected from the central core in the sugar removal process.
	- "0": Preserve all disconnected structures (note: this might lead to no circular sugar 
	  moieties being detected, depending on the other settings)
	- "1": Remove disconnected structures that do not have enough heavy atoms
	- "2": Remove disconnected structures that do not have a sufficient molecular weight
	- Default: "1" (judge disconnected structures by their heavy atom count)
- Option -presThres --preservationModeThreshold <integer>: An integer number giving the threshold of 
  the preservation mode
	- I.e. how many heavy atoms a disconnected structure needs to have at least to be not 
	  removed or how heavy (in terms of its molecular weight) it needs to be
	- Default: "5" (heavy atoms); if the preservation mode option -presMode 
	  --preservationModeOptionis adjusted, this threshold is set to the
	  default value of the respective option (5 heavy atoms or 60 Da).
	- The integer number must be positive
	- If the option -presMode --preservationModeOption was passed the value "0" (preserve all 
	  structures), this option must also be passed a zero value
	- In the opposite case, this argument must be passed a non-zero value if the option -presMode 
	  --preservationModeOption was given the value 1 or 2
- Option -oxyAtoms --detectCircSugOnlyWithEnoughExocycOxyAtoms <boolean>: Either "true" or "false", 
  indicating whether circular sugars should be detected (and removed) only if they have a sufficient 
  number of attached exocyclic oxygen atoms.
	- Any other value of this argument will be interpreted as "false"	
	- Default: "true"
- Option -oxyAtomsThres --exocycOxyAtomsToAtomsInRingRatioThreshold <number>: A number giving the minimum 
  attached exocyclic oxygen atoms to atom number in the ring ratio a circular sugar needs to have to be 
  detected as such.
	- Default: "0.5" (a 6-membered ring needs at least 3 attached exocyclic oxygen atoms)
	- If the option -oxyAtoms --detectCircSugOnlyWithEnoughExocycOxyAtoms was passed the value "false" 
	  (detect circular sugars neglecting their number of attached exocyclic oxygen atoms), this argument 
	  must be passed a zero value
	- In the opposite case, this argument must be passed a non-zero value if the option -oxyAtoms 
	  --detectCircSugOnlyWithEnoughExocycOxyAtoms was given the value "true"
	- The number must be positive
- Option -linSugInRings --detectLinSugInRings <boolean>: Either "true" or "false", indicating whether linear 
  sugars in rings should be detected (and removed)
	- Any other value of this argument will be interpreted as "false"
	- Default: "false"
- Option -linSugMinSize --linSugCandidateMinimumSize <integer>: An integer number indicating the minimum number 
  of carbon atoms a linear sugar needs to have to be detected as such.
	- Default: "4"
	- The integer number must be positive and higher than or equal to 1 and also smaller than the linear 
	  sugar candidate maximum size (option -linSugMaxSize --linSugCandidateMaximumSize)
- Option -linSugMaxSize --linSugCandidateMaximumSize <integer>: An integer number indicating the maximum 
  number of carbon atoms a linear sugar needs to have to be detected as such.
	- Default: "7"
	- The integer number must be positive and higher than or equal to 1 and also higher than the linear 
	  sugar candidate minimum size (option -linSugMinSize --linSugCandidateMinimumSize)
- Option -linAcSug --detectLinAcidicSug <boolean>: Either "true" or "false", indicating whether linear acidic 
  sugars should be included in the set of linear sugar patterns for the initial detection.
	- Any other value of this argument will be interpreted as "false"
	- Default: "false"
- Option -circSugSpiro --detectSpiroRingsAsCircSug <boolean>: Either "true" or "false", indicating whether 
  spiro rings (rings that share one atom with another cycle) should be included in the circular sugar detection.
	- Any other value of this argument will be interpreted as "false"	
	- Default: "false"
