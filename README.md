# Sugar Removal Service

Sugar units in natural products are pharmacokinetically important but often redundant and therefore obstructing the study of the main function of the aglycon. Therefore, it is recommended to remove the sugars before a theoretical or experimental study of a molecule. Deglycogenases, enzymes that specialized in sugar removal from small molecules, are often used in laboratories to perform this task. However, there is no standardized computational procedure to do it in silico.
 
This repository contains the code and the examples for the standalone Java application for in silico removal of ring and linear sugars from molecular structures. Particular attention is given to molecules of biological origin and to their structural specificities. 
The JAR can be downloaded here #### 

A web application for sugar removal, based on this algorithm is available at https://sugar.naturalproducts.net


## Usage

Several of sugars can be removed:

- ring sugars
- linear sugars
- terminal sugars
- non-terminal sugars

... and all the combinations of the above-mentioned sugar types.

### Removing all sugars

here example

### Removing ring sugars

example all rings
example terminal ring only
example non-terminal rings only
